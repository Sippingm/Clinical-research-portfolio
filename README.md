# Clinical Research Portfolio – Marius Sipping  

I am a Certified Clinical Research Professional transitioning from 10+ years of preclinical research in oncology, autoimmune, and infectious diseases into clinical research. I have hands-on experience with ICH-GCP, protocol review, site evaluation, feasibility assessments, site selection workflows, SSU operations, and regulatory documentation.

My background includes over 15 peer-reviewed publications, grant-funded projects, and extensive laboratory expertise spanning molecular biology, pharmacology, and biotechnology. I am fluent in English and French, with strong data analysis skills and experience collaborating across international research environments.

Current Focus: Clinical Trial Operations • SSU • Protocol Analysis • Feasibility • Monitoring • Regulatory Compliance 

## Project: GZB Study - Site Activation & Feasibility

### 1. Protocol Dissection & Comprehension
Activity: Conducted an in-depth review and presentation of the GZB study protocol.

Skills Demonstrated:

Ability to critically analyze a clinical study protocol.

Identified key elements per discipline: eligibility criteria, endpoints, visit schedules, and safety reporting.

Understanding of Phase I study considerations and requirements.

### 2. Feasibility Questionnaire (FQ) Assessment
Activity: Reviewed and assessed site-specific Feasibility Questionnaires to determine site selection readiness.

Skills Demonstrated:

Evaluated site capabilities, patient population, and resources against protocol requirements.

Made data-driven recommendations on site acceptability.

Applied Phase I-specific feasibility criteria.

### 4. Site Selection & Assignment

Activity: Reviewed and documented operational insights for 10 assigned sites.

Skills Demonstrated: 
Mapped all PI assignments, estimated site activation timelines, and identified potential bottlenecks.

Demonstrated understanding of site performance metrics and early‑phase study considerations.


### 5. Statement of Work (SOW) Review
Activity: Analyzed the Study Statement of Work to understand study timelines, deliverables, and budget considerations.

Skills Demonstrated: Ability to interpret contractual and operational study plans.

### 6. Regulatory Documentation & SSU Tracker Management
Activity: Prepared for the collection and review of essential regulatory documents required for IRB submission and site activation.

Skills Demonstrated:

Knowledge of the essential documents listed in the Regulatory Binder Checklist.

Understanding the process of creating and maintaining an SSU Tracker to monitor document collection from PI, Sub-Is, CRCs, and lab directors.

Awareness of how regulatory document delays impact site activation timelines.
